# Tipping

## Sending Tips to GitHub Users with the @gibworkbot on Solana

This guide explains how to use the @gibworkbot, a Solana bot that allows you to send SOL tokens as tips to GitHub users directly within comments or direct messages.

### Requirements

* A Solana wallet with SOL tokens.
* A GitHub account.

### Instructions

1. **Mention the bot:** In a GitHub comment or direct message, start your message by mentioning the bot's username: `@gibworkbot`.
2. **Specify the action:** Include the keyword "tip" to indicate you want to send a tip.
3. **Enter the amount:** Specify the amount of SOL you want to send. Use the following format: `<amount> SOL`. For example, to send 0.5 SOL, type: `0.5 SOL`.
4. **Mention the recipient:** Mention the username of the GitHub user you want to tip. For example, to tip a user named "coder123", type: `@coder123`.

**Example:**

```
@gibworkbot tip 0.1 SOL @username
```

This message would send 0.1 SOL to the GitHub user username.

### Additional Notes

* Ensure you have enough SOL tokens in your wallet to cover the tip amount and any network fees.
* The bot currently only supports sending SOL tokens.
* Tips are sent directly to the recipient's Solana wallet address associated with their GitHub account.
* For security reasons, never share your private key or seed phrase with anyone, including the bot.
